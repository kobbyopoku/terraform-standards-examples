# Code Structure - Terraform Module Standards - Example 5

Modules **_MUST_** include an examples directory.  If CI\CD testing is available, modules **_SHOULD_** contain a tests directory.

This example shows the proper directory structure to use for Terraform Module examples.  All examples should be located in an `examples` folder at the root of the module.  Each example should be located in a unique subdirectory, and should adhere to all other best practices.
