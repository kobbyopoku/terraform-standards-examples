# Code Structure - Resource and Data Source Arguments - Example 4

Resource properties that can be defined on a single line should be grouped together and sorted in alphabetical order. If logical separation of properties is desired, then multiple groups can be separated by a blank line and a comment describing the group. Each group would then be sorted in alphabetical order.

- [good.tf](good.tf) shows a resource with parameters alphabetically ordered.
- [bad.tf](bad.tf) shows a resource with parameters in a non-ordered manner.
